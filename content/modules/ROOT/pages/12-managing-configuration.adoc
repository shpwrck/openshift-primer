= Managing Configuration

OpenShift applications often require configuration data that is external to the container image. This page explains how to use ConfigMaps and Secrets to provide environment-specific settings and how changes can be automatically reflected in running pods.

== PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims

== ConfigMaps

A **ConfigMap** stores non-sensitive configuration data as key-value pairs. You can use ConfigMaps to:

* Set environment variables
* Mount configuration files into containers
* Decouple config from application code

Example ConfigMap:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  APP_MODE: production
  LOG_LEVEL: debug
----

Mounting the config as environment variables:

[source,yaml]
----
envFrom:
- configMapRef:
    name: app-config
----

Or as files in a volume:

[source,yaml]
----
volumeMounts:
- name: config-volume
  mountPath: /etc/config
volumes:
- name: config-volume
  configMap:
    name: app-config
----

=== Exercise: Use a ConfigMap

. Create a ConfigMap:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_MODE=production --from-literal=LOG_LEVEL=debug
----
. Create a pod that uses it as environment variables.
. Use `oc exec` to shell into the pod and check the env values.

== Secrets

A **Secret** is used to store sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or keys. Like ConfigMaps, Secrets can be used as:

* Environment variables
* Volume-mounted files

Secrets are base64-encoded, not encrypted by default (encryption at rest must be enabled cluster-wide).

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=   # admin
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # password
----

Referencing the secret:

[source,yaml]
----
env:
- name: DB_USER
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: db-secret
      key: username
----

=== Exercise: Use a Secret

. Create a secret with base64-encoded values or use the CLI:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=username=admin --from-literal=password=password
----
. Deploy a pod that uses the secret as env vars.
. Confirm secret values are available inside the container using `echo $DB_USER`.

== Automation: Updating Pods with New Configurations

By default, changes to ConfigMaps or Secrets **do not** automatically restart or reload running pods.

However, OpenShift supports **automatic update propagation** via volume mounts:

* When mounted as volumes, updated values are **eventually** reflected in the container (typically within a minute).
* Environment variable usage does **not** support automatic updates.

For changes to take effect immediately in env vars, pods must be manually restarted.

=== Best Practices

* Use volume mounts if you want in-place updates.
* Use `DeploymentConfig` triggers with ImageStreams or ConfigMap changes for full redeployment.
* Use `oc rollout restart` for manual restarts.

[source,sh]
----
oc rollout restart deployment my-app
----

=== Exercise: Observe ConfigMap Update Propagation

. Create a pod with a ConfigMap mounted as a volume.
. Inside the pod, `cat` the config file.
. Update the ConfigMap using:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_MODE=debug -o yaml --dry-run=client | oc apply -f -
----
. Wait ~1 minute, then re-check the mounted file in the pod.
. Optional: restart the pod and confirm the update happens immediately.
