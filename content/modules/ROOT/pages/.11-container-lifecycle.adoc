= Container Lifecycle

OpenShift manages the lifecycle of container images from initial pull to eventual removal. Understanding how images are handled helps ensure consistency, performance, and security in your applications.

== Image Policy

OpenShift controls how and when images are pulled using its **image pull policy**, which is defined in the pod or deployment specification.

=== Common Policies

* `Always` – Pull the image every time the pod starts (default for `:latest` tag).
* `IfNotPresent` – Pull the image only if it's not already cached on the node.
* `Never` – Never pull the image; use only what's already present on the node.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myregistry.io/myimage:latest
    imagePullPolicy: Always
----

TIP: For predictable deployments, avoid `:latest` and prefer fixed tags or digests.

=== Exercise: Test Image Pull Behavior

. Deploy a pod with `imagePullPolicy: Always` and update the image tag in the registry.
. Re-deploy the pod and confirm the image is re-pulled.
. Repeat using `IfNotPresent` and observe the difference.

[#external-registries]
== External Registries

By default, OpenShift pulls from public or authenticated registries like Docker Hub or Quay.io. Pulling from **private or self-hosted registries** requires extra configuration.

=== Steps to Use an External Registry

1. Create a Kubernetes `Secret` with your registry credentials:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create secret docker-registry my-registry-secret \
  --docker-server=registry.example.com \
  --docker-username=myuser \
  --docker-password=mypassword \
  --docker-email=user@example.com
----
2. Link the secret to your service account:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc secrets link default my-registry-secret --for=pull
----

=== Exercise: Use a Private Image

. Set up a secret for an external registry.
. Create a pod that pulls an image from the registry.
. Confirm the image is pulled and the pod starts successfully.

== Image Streams

OpenShift provides **ImageStreams**, a Kubernetes-compatible abstraction to track changes to images over time.

=== Pros

* Automatically detect new image versions and trigger builds/deployments.
* Integrates with BuildConfigs and DeploymentConfigs.
* Provides consistent naming and referencing.

=== Cons

* Adds complexity if you're already using standard Kubernetes tooling.
* Requires additional OpenShift-specific resources.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: myapp
----

=== Exercise: Create and Use an ImageStream

. Define an `ImageStream` and link it to a DeploymentConfig.
. Push a new version of the image to the source registry.
. Watch the DeploymentConfig auto-trigger a new rollout.

== Tags and Digests

Images can be referenced by:

* **Tags** – human-readable labels like `:v1.0`, `:latest`
* **Digests** – immutable SHA256 hashes

Example digest reference:

[source,yaml]
----
image: myimage@sha256:ab1234...
----

=== Why Use Digests?

* Digests guarantee **immutability** — the image will never change.
* Tags can point to different versions over time, which may lead to drift or bugs.

TIP: Use digests for production deployments to ensure consistency.

== Process: Image Lifecycle in OpenShift

The full lifecycle of an image inside OpenShift includes:

.Diagram: Image Lifecycle
image::image-lifecycle.png[]

1. **Pull** – The image is downloaded to the node from a registry.
2. **Use** – The image is run inside pods.
3. **Cache** – The image is cached on the node for future reuse.
4. **Prune (Garbage Collection)** – Images not in use can be cleaned up:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc adm prune images
----

You can configure image pruning based on age, usage, or tag history limits.

=== Exercise: View and Prune Images

. Run:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc adm top images
----
to view storage usage.
. Simulate a prune operation:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc adm prune images --confirm
----

NOTE: Pruning should only be done by cluster admins with caution.
